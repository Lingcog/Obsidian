"Jesus said, 'Blessed is he who came into being before he came into being. If you become my disciples and listen to my words, these stones will minister to you. For there are five trees for you in Paradise that do not change, either in summer or in winter, and whose leaves do not fall. Whoever knows them will not taste death.'"

[[Thomasevangeliet]]

Question:
Could the five trees refer to our five senses as gate ways to a paradise like state?

Answer:
The interpretation of the five trees in Saying 19 from the Gospel of Thomas as representing our five senses is a fascinating and insightful perspective. This view aligns with various spiritual and philosophical traditions that see the senses not only as means of engaging with the physical world but also as gateways to deeper, spiritual experiences. Here’s how this interpretation might unfold:

### The Senses as Gateways:

- **Transcendence Through Sensory Experience:** Instead of viewing the senses merely as conduits for worldly and material perception, this interpretation suggests that deep, mindful engagement with sensory experiences can lead to transcendent states of consciousness or "paradise-like" states of being. The key is the quality of attention and presence brought to these experiences.

### Mindfulness and Presence:

- **Enhanced Awareness:** Mindful observation and presence in sensory experiences can enhance one’s awareness of the moment, fostering a deeper connection to the divine presence in all things. This heightened state of awareness can be akin to experiencing a form of paradise here and now.

### Integration of the Material and Spiritual:

- **Harmony Between the Physical and Spiritual:** By understanding the senses as bridges between the physical and spiritual realms, one can achieve a harmonious integration of both aspects of existence. The senses become tools for spiritual awakening and understanding, rather than distractions or obstacles on the path.

### The Unchanging Nature of the Divine:

- **Eternal Truths Beyond Sensory Fluctuation:** Just as the five trees in the saying do not change with the seasons, the divine truths or insights gained through the senses are constant and unchanging despite the ever-changing nature of sensory experiences. This suggests a deeper, eternal reality that can be accessed through mindful engagement with the sensory world.

### Inner Transformation:

- **Transformation of Perception:** This perspective implies that the transformation required to "not taste death" involves a change in how we perceive and interact with the world through our senses. By reorienting our sensory experiences towards the pursuit of spiritual understanding and enlightenment, we can transcend the limitations of the physical world.

This interpretation of the five trees offers a practical and experiential approach to spiritual growth, emphasizing the potential of everyday experiences as avenues for discovering deeper truths and achieving a state of inner peace and transcendence. It encourages an active engagement with the world in a way that is mindful, appreciative, and open to the divine.

Question:
How in a practical can mundane experiences be a gateway to the divine- let’s take sense of seeing. What should I be on the look out for? Any way I can prepare my mind?

Answer:
### Mindful Observation

- **Practice Mindfulness:** Begin with the practice of mindfulness by paying close attention to whatever you see. This could be as simple as observing the play of light on surfaces, the colors and textures of objects, or the movements of people and animals. Try to see each sight as if for the first time, noticing details you might usually overlook.
- **Seek the Extraordinary in the Ordinary:** Approach everyday scenes and objects with a sense of wonder and curiosity. Even the most ordinary objects have depth, history, and beauty when we truly look.

### Symbolic Seeing

- **Look for Symbols:** Many spiritual traditions imbue symbols with deep meanings. As you observe your surroundings, consider what symbolic meanings various sights might hold. A tree might symbolize growth and resilience; water might remind you of purity and fluidity. Connecting physical sights to symbolic meanings can deepen your spiritual awareness.
- **Nature as a Mirror:** Nature is often seen as a direct manifestation of the divine. Spend time in nature, observing it not just as a collection of plants, animals, and elements, but as a living, breathing expression of spiritual truths.

### Reflective Seeing

- **Contemplative Photography:** Use photography as a form of meditation. Take photos of things that move you spiritually, then reflect on why these sights touch you. This can be a form of visual journaling, where the act of seeing becomes a reflective practice.
- **Art as a Window:** Engage with art—whether creating it yourself or appreciating others' work—as a way to see through to the divine. Art can express and evoke feelings and insights that transcend ordinary experience.

### Preparing Your Mind

- **Cultivate Intention:** Start your day with the intention to see the world with fresh eyes, looking for the divine in all things. This intentionality can shift your perspective.
- **Practice Gratitude:** Cultivate a habit of gratitude for the beauty and complexity of the world around you. Gratitude opens the heart, which in turn opens the eyes to see the divine in everyday life.
- **Meditate on Vision:** Spend time in meditation focusing on the act of seeing. Visualize opening your spiritual eye, asking for the grace to see the divine presence in the world around you.

### Integrating Seeing with Being

- **Be Present:** Truly being present in the moment allows you to fully engage with what you are seeing. Presence turns seeing from a passive to an active, engaged process.
- **Silence and Stillness:** Spend time in silence and stillness, allowing the mind to settle. A calm mind is more receptive to the subtle spiritual messages present in the world around you.

By transforming how you see, you transform your experience of the world. Mundane experiences can become filled with spiritual significance, turning every moment of seeing into an opportunity to connect with the divine.
