**Bevægelse integreret med læring - Side 203**- “Our new conception stresses the importance of movement as a help to the development of the brain, once it is placed in relation to the centre. Mental development and even spiritual development can and must be helped by movement. Without movement there is no progress and no health (mentally speaking). This is a fundamental fact which must be taken into con-
sideration”
