“The disciples said to Jesus, 'Tell us what the Kingdom of Heaven is like.' He said to them, 'It is like a mustard seed, the smallest of all seeds, but when it falls on tilled soil, it produces a great plant and becomes a shelter for birds of the sky.'"

 This session provides a structured approach to deeply engage with Saying 20, offering an opportunity for profound reflection on the potential for spiritual growth that lies within the smallest beginnings and the importance of preparing oneself to nurture such growth. The metaphor of the mustard seed invites contemplation on the nature of the Kingdom of Heaven as something that starts small within us but has the potential to grow into something vast and sheltering, transforming not just the individual but providing shelter for others.

### Symbol of Small Beginnings and Great Endings

- The mustard seed is often interpreted as a symbol of the Kingdom of Heaven's paradoxical nature: it begins as the smallest of seeds yet grows into a large plant. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual growth and the development of faith, where the smallest act of faith or smallest insight into spiritual truth can grow into something vast and encompassing.

### Inner Spiritual Growth

- In the context of the Gospel of Thomas, which emphasizes personal knowledge and inner spiritual discovery, the mustard seed could symbolize the initial spark of divine understanding or the smallest insight that, when nurtured, expands within the individual to reveal the vastness of the Kingdom of Heaven. This growth is internal and personal, emphasizing the transformative journey of the soul.

### The Unexpected Nature of the Kingdom of Heaven

- The parable may also highlight the unexpected and counterintuitive ways in which the Kingdom of Heaven manifests. Just as the mustard seed defies expectations by growing into a large plant, so too the Kingdom of Heaven unfolds in ways that transcend human expectations, often found in humble beginnings or places of low esteem according to worldly standards.

### A Call to Prepare the "Soil" of the Heart

- The reference to the seed falling on tilled soil suggests that receptivity is crucial for spiritual growth. In this interpretation, the "soil" could represent the state of the individual's heart and mind, and the parable serves as a call to prepare oneself—through practices such as meditation, prayer, and ethical living—to be receptive to spiritual truths.

### Community and Shelter

- The image of the mustard plant providing shelter for birds can symbolize the nurturing and inclusive nature of the Kingdom of Heaven. It suggests a community that grows from small beginnings to provide refuge and support, reflecting the interconnectedness of all beings within the divine plan.

### A Connection to Jewish Mystical Traditions

- The mustard seed's growth into a large plant may also resonate with Jewish mystical ideas present in the religious and cultural milieu of early Christianity, where small actions or minor commandments could have profound spiritual implications, echoing themes of potentiality and transformation found in Kabbalistic thought.

The Gospel of Thomas's version of the mustard seed parable, like its counterparts in the canonical gospels, invites a contemplation of the Kingdom of Heaven's mysterious and transformative presence in the world. It underscores the value of small beginnings, the importance of personal spiritual cultivation, and the boundless potential for growth and shelter within the divine realm.
