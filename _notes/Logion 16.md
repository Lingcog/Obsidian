[[Alkymistiske process (tarot)]]

"Men think, perhaps, that it is peace which I have come to cast upon the world. They do not know that it is dissension which I have come to cast upon the earth: fire, sword, and war. For there will be five in a house: three will be against two, and two against three, the father against the son, and the son against the father. And they will stand solitary."



Are there any references to alchemy in this saying: 

Answer:
Saying 16 from the Gospel of Thomas speaks to themes of division, inner conflict, and the transformative journey of the soul, which can be related metaphorically to the alchemical process. While the saying does not explicitly reference alchemy, the themes it touches upon resonate with the symbolic nature of alchemical transformation. Alchemy, in both its material and spiritual forms, is concerned with the transformation of the base into the noble, the lead into gold, or the unenlightened self into the enlightened self.

The process of alchemy is often described through stages, the most famous of which are the nigredo (blackening), albedo (whitening), citrinitas (yellowing), and rubedo (reddening). Saying 16 could metaphorically relate to the initial stages of alchemical transformation:

1. **Nigredo:** The stage of decomposition or putrefaction, where all elements are broken down to their base components. This can be likened to the dissension and conflict mentioned in Saying 16, where existing structures, beliefs, and relationships are challenged and broken down, often leading to a period of darkness or confusion in the seeker's journey.
    
2. **Albedo:** Following the chaos of the nigredo, the albedo represents purification and the washing away of impurities. It is a stage of reflection, insight, and gaining clarity, though not yet complete transformation. The conflict and division in Saying 16 could serve as the catalyst for this purification, as the individual begins to see beyond the superficial to the deeper truths within.
    

While Saying 16 does not directly reference the subsequent stages of citrinitas and rubedo, which represent enlightenment and the achievement of the Magnum Opus or Great Work, the notion of standing solitary amidst conflict and division can be seen as part of the journey towards such transformation. The solitude might symbolize the alchemist's or seeker's need to stand apart from prevailing societal or external norms to achieve true understanding and transformation.

In the context of alchemy, then, Saying 16 could be interpreted as highlighting the necessary and often painful processes of dissolution and purification that precede the final transformationâ€”echoing the spiritual alchemy of the soul's journey toward enlightenment or gnosis.
